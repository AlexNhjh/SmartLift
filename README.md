SmartLift aims to offer form corrections for new powerlifters, without the hassle of hiring a coach. 

Lifting data from advanced lifters is recorded using Mediapipe, which provides semi-accurate x,y,z coordinates for 33 landmarks on the human body. These numbers can then be used to calculate joint angles among other important lifting factors. Videos of lifts are uploaded into the "Videos" folder containing the name of the lift and whether it was executed well or not. The lifts for each video are passed through a rep detection algoritm so that each rep can be analyzed independently. 

After the data has been fully gathered and organized, the model can be trained (in-progress)
