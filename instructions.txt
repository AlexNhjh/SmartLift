install python 3.11 (or earlier) and set it as your interpreter

libraries required:
    npzviewer - pip install npzviewer - used to view the large npz files that are otherwise hard to interpret
    numpy
    mediapipe
    opencv - pip install opencv-python

upload your video into the videos folder. Make sure the name of the lift (e.g. squat, bench, or deadlift
is the first word in the title). The data for your joint positions and angles is collected and separated
into a different subfolder in data as an npz file (good for storing large amounts of array-like data).
run python-m npzviewer to start npzviewer, and open the desired files to see the joint/point data.
